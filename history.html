        <h2>Formation and early history (1965-1973)</h2>
        <p>
          Rudolf Schenker, the band's rhythm/lead guitarist, launched the band
          in 1965. Initially the band had Merseybeat influences and Schenker
          himself handled the vocals. He played in a band with Lothar Heimberg
          before he founded Scorpions. Karl Heinz Vollmer left the band in 1967
          because of his military obligations; military service precluded him
          from performing in concerts. Things began to come together in 1969
          when Schenker's younger brother Michael and vocalist Klaus Meine, who
          had played together in the Led Zeppelin and Taste cover band
          Copernicus, joined the band. With this line-up they won a music
          contest in 1972 and recorded two songs for a single that was never
          released on the CCA label, but the songs, "Action" and "I'm Going Mad"
          were later released on different compilation albums including
          Psychedelic Gems 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1972 the group recorded and released their debut album, Lonesome
          Crow, with Lothar Heimberg on bass and Wolfgang Dziony on drums and
          re-recorded their CCA songs. During the Lonesome Crow tour Scorpions
          opened for up-and-coming British band UFO. Near the end of the tour,
          guitarist Michael Schenker accepted an offer to play lead guitar for
          UFO. Uli Jon Roth, a friend of Michael's, was then introduced to the
          band and he helped them to finish off the tour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The departure of Michael Schenker led to the breakup of the band. In
          1973, Uli Roth, who had helped Scorpions complete the Lonesome Crow
          tour, was offered the role of lead guitarist, but turned the band
          down, preferring instead to remain in the band Dawn Road. Rudolf
          Schenker eventually decided he wanted to work with Roth, but did not
          want to resurrect the last Scorpions line-up. He attended some of Dawn
          Road's rehearsals and ultimately decided to join the band, which
          consisted of Roth, Francis Buchholz (bass), Achim Kirschning
          (keyboards) and Jürgen Rosenthal (drums). Uli Roth and Buchholz
          persuaded Rudolf Schenker to invite Klaus Meine to join on vocals,
          which he soon did. While there were more members of Dawn Road than
          Scorpions in the band, they decided to use the Scorpions name because
          it was well known on the German hard rock scene and an album had been
          released under that name.

        <h2>Rise to fame (1974-1978)</h2>
        <p>
          In 1974, the new line-up released Fly to the Rainbow. The album proved
          to be more successful than Lonesome Crow and songs such as "Speedy's
          Coming" and the title track established the band's sound. Achim
          Kirschning decided to leave after the recordings. Soon after, Jürgen
          Rosenthal had to leave as he was drafted into the army (he later
          joined German progressive rock band Eloy, recording three albums).
          Rosenthal was replaced in July 1974 by Jürgen Fechter, and then in
          1975 Rudy Lenners from Belgium became the band's next drummer. That
          year, the band released In Trance, which marked the beginning of their
          long collaboration with German producer Dieter Dierks. The album was a
          huge step forward for the Scorpions and established their heavy metal
          formula. It garnered a fan base at home and abroad with cuts such as
          "In Trance", "Dark Lady" and "Robot Man".
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, as "The Hunters", the band recorded "Fuchs geh' voran" and
          "Wenn es richtig losgeht", German language cover versions of "Action"
          and "Fox on the Run" by the Sweet for EMI's Electrola label. In 1976,
          the Scorpions released Virgin Killer, the album cover of which
          featured a nude prepubescent girl behind a broken pane of glass. The
          cover art was designed by Stefan Bohle, who was the product manager
          for the West German division of RCA Records,[14] their label at the
          time. The cover brought the band considerable market exposure as well
          as controversy and was subsequently pulled or replaced in other
          countries because of its imagery. The album itself garnered widespread
          praise for its music from select critics and fan base. In 2008, the
          cover art on the English Wikipedia was briefly blacklisted by the
          Internet Watch Foundation, before reversing their decision 4 days
          later. The following year, Rudy Lenners resigned for personal reasons
          and was replaced by Herman Rarebell, an experienced musician who had
          recorded with the bands Missus Beastly and Onyx. For the follow-up
          Taken by Force, RCA Records made a determined effort to promote the
          album in stores and on the radio. The album's single, "Steamrock
          Fever", was added to some of RCA's radio promotional records. Roth was
          not happy with the commercial direction the band was taking. Although
          he performed on the band's Japan tour, he departed to form his own
          band, Electric Sun prior to the release of the resultant double live
          album Tokyo Tapes. Tokyo Tapes was released in the US and Europe six
          months after its Japanese release. By that time in mid-1978, after
          auditioning around 140 guitarists, the Scorpions recruited Matthias
          Jabs, a veteran of the German rock scene who had played in the bands
          Lady and Fargo.

        <h2>Later years</h2>
        <p>
          In 1993, the Scorpions released Face the Heat. Bass was handled by
          Ralph Rieckermann. For the recording process, the band brought in
          producer Bruce Fairbairn. The album's sound was more metal than
          melodic. Neither the heavy metal single "Alien Nation" nor the ballad
          "Under the Same Sun" came close to matching the success of "Wind of
          Change". Face the Heat was a moderate success. In 1995, a new album,
          Live Bites, was produced. The disc documented retro live performances
          from their Savage Amusement Tour in 1988, all the way through the Face
          the Heat Tour in 1994. While the album had a technologically cleaner
          sound in comparison to their best-selling live album, World Wide Live,
          it was not as successful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to recording their 13th studio album, 1996's Pure Instinct,
          drummer Herman Rarebell left the band to set up a recording label.
          Curt Cress took charge of the drumsticks for the album before
          Louisville, Kentucky-born James Kottak took over permanently. The
          album had many ballads. Still, the album's singles "Wild Child" and
          the soothing ballad "You and I" both enjoyed moderate success. 1999
          saw the release of Eye II Eye and a significant change in the band's
          style, mixing in elements of pop and techno. While the album was
          slickly produced, it was not received well by fans. The video to the
          album's first European single, "To Be No. 1", featured a Monica
          Lewinsky look-alike which did little to improve its popularity.
